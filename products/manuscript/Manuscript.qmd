#Preface

Hello! My name is Vijay Panthayi. The following is the complete Manuscript for my MADA Data Analysis Final Project. This project will explore Climate Change, Forest Area, and Carbon Stock data obtained from IMF. Outlined below are the steps and information needed to both understand and fully reproduce the analysis. Thank you for your time.

# Introduction 

## General Background Information
Climate change is the term coined to represent the long-term changes, or shifts, in temperatures and weather patterns across the globe. For the longest time, the Earth has been in a constant pattern of climate change as there was equal fluctuation of carbon exchange between the atmosphere, water, and ground. However, since the 1800s, human activity has been a direct factor of climate change's rapid increase from the norm. This is primarily due to the burning of fossil fuels (coal, oil, gas) which produces heat-trapping gasses. Over time, as these heat-trapping gasses accumulate in the atmosphere, more and more heat from the Sun is retained on the Earth causing it's global temperatures to increase yearly. Aside from data showing that global temperatures are rising across the board, we have also experienced the five hottest months on Earth ever in only the last 5 years. This gives protecting our Earth a whole new level of importance, and with that, means studying the data behind it important too.

The primary method of preventing our planet from becoming the next Sun in the solar system is to reduce the amount of emissions humans produce. Switching to renewable energy sources (solar and/or wind) is a fantastic way of reducing the amount humans contribute to climate change. However, it is also important to study the way the planet has naturally dealt with the carbon cycle prior to human impact. Plants, through photosynthesis, consume carbon dioxide through a series of chemical reactions to produce oxygen, energy, and by-products. A large amount of plants, say a forest, would have a large impact in the consumption of emissions thrown into the atmosphere. In fact, forests contain the largest stock of land-based carbon. It is also important to study forest area and their carbon stock to have a deeper understanding of climate change and its factors and solutions.

## Description of data and data source
The data being explored in this project comes from IMF (International Monetary Fund). The IMF is a major financial agency of the United Nations consisting of 190 countries. Its mission is "working to foster global monetary cooperation, secure financial stability, facilitate international trade, promote high employment and sustainable growth, and reduce poverty around the world". The IMF works towards their mission by surveillance of its members' economies and demands of particular policies through the actions and activities of funds and gathering  statistics and analysis.

There are two data sets obtained from the IMF data website that will be explored in this project. The first data set is of Annual Surface Temperature Change. This sheet contains the mean surface temperature change during 1961-2021 compared to the baseline temperatures of 1951-1980. There are 225 observations. This data is obtained for multiple countries across the globe and contains the temperature changes yearly in Celsius. This data is provided to the IMF by the Food and Agriculture Organization Corporate Statistical Database (FAOSTAT) and is based on publicly available GISTEMP data from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Goddard Institute for Space Studies (NASA GISS). The second data set is Forest and Carbon. This sheet contains the % share of forest area, carbon stock index, and carbon stock in forests values for most countries in the world from 1992 to 2020. There are 1353 observations. Each subject (country) takes up approximately 6 observations for each of the following per country: carbon stocks in forest, forest area, index of carbon stocks in forests, index of forest extent, land area, share of forest area. When considering that each subject conjures approximately 6 observations, there are approximately 226 subjects (same number of countries in the temperature set plus one for global).

## Questions/Hypotheses to be addressed
The questions/hypotheses to be addressed are the following:
    1. Which countries/areas around the globe are experiencing the largest changes in climate? (Are there similarities amongst them?)
    2. Is there a correlation between % share of forest and temperature change experienced?
    3. What are future implications of not changing anything about how we run the world?
    
    
    

To cite other work (important everywhere, but likely happens first in introduction), make sure your references are in the bibtex file specified in the YAML header above (here `dataanalysis_template_references.bib`) and have the right bibtex key. Then you can include like this:

Examples of reproducible research projects can for instance be found in [@mckay2020; @mckay2020a]

# Methods 

## Data aquisition
Both the data sets were acquired from the IMF climate change dashboard website. This website can be found here: https://climatedata.imf.org/pages/climatechange-data . The two data sets used were labeled "Annual Surface Temperature Change" and "Forest and Carbon". 


## Data import and cleaning
The data importing, cleaning, and processing was done in a QMD file that can be found by going to Code > processing_code > processing_code.qmd. There you will find the code that completed these steps along with the explanations with each step.


## Statistical analysis
First, an analysis of covariance was performed to determine if there were similar trends in climate change temperature and forest area/index changes over time. Afterwards, a train/test method analysis was performed on the data. Further steps and explanations can be found in the Code > analysis_code > analysis_code.qmd file.

# Results

## Exploratory/Descriptive analysis

_Use a combination of text/tables/figures to explore and describe your data. Show the most important descriptive results here. Additional ones should go in the supplement. Even more can be in the R and Quarto files that are part of your project._


@tbl-summarytable shows a summary of the data.

Note the loading of the data providing a **relative** path using the `../../` notation. (Two dots means a folder up). You never want to specify an **absolute** path like `C:\ahandel\myproject\results\` because if you share this with someone, it won't work for them since they don't have that path. You can also use the `here` R package to create paths. See examples of that below.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-summarytable
#| tbl-cap: "Data summary table."
#| echo: FALSE
resulttable=readRDS("../../results/summarytable.rds")
knitr::kable(resulttable)
```



## Basic statistical analysis

_To get some further insight into your data, if reasonable you could compute simple statistics (e.g. simple models with 1 predictor) to look for associations between your outcome(s) and each individual predictor variable. Though note that unless you pre-specified the outcome and main exposure, any "p<0.05 means statistical significance" interpretation is not valid._


@fig-result shows a scatterplot figure produced by one of the R scripts.

```{r}
#| label: fig-result
#| fig-cap: "Height and weight stratified by gender."
#| echo: FALSE
knitr::include_graphics(here("results","height_weight_stratified.png"))
```


## Full analysis

_Use one or several suitable statistical/machine learning methods to analyze your data and to produce meaningful figures, tables, etc. This might again be code that is best placed in one or several separate R scripts that need to be well documented. You want the code to produce figures and data ready for display as tables, and save those. Then you load them here._

Example @tbl-resulttable2 shows a summary of a linear model fit.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-resulttable2
#| tbl-cap: "Linear model fit table."
#| echo: FALSE
resulttable2 = readRDS(here("results","resulttable2.rds"))
knitr::kable(resulttable2)
```

# Discussion

## Summary and Interpretation
_Summarize what you did, what you found and what it means._

## Strengths and Limitations
_Discuss what you perceive as strengths and limitations of your analysis._

## Conclusions
_What are the main take-home messages?_

_Include citations in your Rmd file using bibtex, the list of references will automatically be placed at the end_

This paper [@leek2015] discusses types of analyses. 

These papers [@mckay2020; @mckay2020a] are good examples of papers published using a fully reproducible setup similar to the one shown in this template. 

Note that this cited reference will show up at the end of the document, the reference formatting is determined by the CSL file specified in the YAML header. Many more style files for almost any journal [are available](https://www.zotero.org/styles). You also specify the location of your bibtex reference file in the YAML. You can call your reference file anything you like, I just used the generic word `references.bib` but giving it a more descriptive name is probably better.
